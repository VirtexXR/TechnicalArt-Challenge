## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Make sure that you are using Unreal 4.26.2 or above

## The Problem

We need a hologram shader that can be used to present 2D advertisment banners within various environments inside our app. 

This shader must contain the folllowing features:
- Static
- Scan Lines
- Color Tint

The banners will be displayed in a range of standalone and mounted (with a background) scenarios so you will have to account for this in design of things like opacity.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is to show your ability to take a briefing for something such as a custom shader and implement something that could be used in a variety of settings leveraging a well structured master material and metrial instances.

This is not intended to be a complex feature rich shader with every single thing paramatised and customisable, more so something simple that demonstates your ability to develop custom shaders in unreal.

The total time spent on this test should be no more than 1 day.

## Requirements

- Submitted as an Unreal Engine Project file in addition to source files for your respective modelling/texturing software
- Works in VR (no screen space effects)
- Ensure the materials respect PBR values

## Submission

To submit your work please upload the relevant files (FBXs, Substance, Blender files, Unreal files, TGAs) to WeTransfer or GDrive. Once ready please share with [Raoul](mailto:raoul@virtexstadium.com)
